# Critiques of the Chicago Tribune’s Data Story on Shootings in Chicago

Shooting in Chicago is one of the most popular data stories for media outlets but the Chicago Tribune’s  data story is one of the best I have seen recently. The Chicago Tribune uses data to show how many people have been shot in 2018 so far. The audience can have comparative information on number of shootings periodically that occurred between 2012 and 2018.  

## Infographic makes the story more useful to obtain detailed information for audiences

The Chicago Tribune also provide detailed information when shootings occur and when homicide tend to peak in the year. Audiences are able to have this information from charts which shows the timeline of  shootings in Chicago periodically by month, day and time.  The story uses the infographic map to show where shootings victims are most concentrated in the city.  What we learn from this map is that shootings mostly happen in South and West sides. This is a really useful and informative map for readers that they are able to see where each shooting incident happened by clicking the map.

The story also gives information about most recent 50 victims from shootings in 2018. Audiences can have more detailed information by clicking the news in the box which links the audiences to related news about the incident published in Chicago Tribune. 

## The story would be more informative, if it shows why number of shootings decreased

All of data on shootings in Chicago is clear and helpful. According to the story, 569 people in Chicago  have been shot this year which is 241 fewer than 2017. I wonder what would be the reasons of this dramatic decrease of shootings to compare last year in the same period? So, I believe, the story should give some information from experts about their assumptions or predictions on fall of shootings in Chicago so far in 2018. Also, it would be more helpful, if the story would include information about shootings in other cities in Illinois, so that audience can compare shootings statistics to other cities that would be more valuable information for them.
