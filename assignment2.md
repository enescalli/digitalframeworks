# Question: "How many Syrian refugees have fled to Turkey since the Syrian civil war begin?"

According to the [United Nations](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/syria/location/113), Turkey hosts more than 3.5 million (3,572,565) Syrian refugees, making Turkey the nation with the highest number of refugees in the world. The statistics of Syrian refugees in United Nations has been gathered by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNCHR), which “employs 10,966 staff members, of whom around 87 per cent are based in the field.” Also, United Nations Refugee Agency works in 130 countries, including Turkey. All of the capabilities of the UN make this institution the most reliable source of data on the Syrian refugees. The website of the UNCHR regularly updates information on Syrian refugees, allowing users to access the most recent and relevant data.
 
UNHCR gathers information about Syrian refugees in Turkey who are cooperating with the Turkish government. The UNCHR’s official website says that the source of the number of Syrian refugees in Turkey is “the Turkish government." This is really important. The Turkish Statistical Institute is the biggest data center in Turkey working under the Turkish government, providing data on not only the number of Syrian refugees but also more detailed information about their incomes, ages and life conditions.
 
Also, the United Nations has been cooperating with the Turkish government on many topics related to the Syrian refugees since the Syrian civil war begin. Representatives of the UN have been visiting the Syrian camps in Turkey and meeting with Turkish officials frequently. This proves the United Nations and Turkey have a good working relationship with regard to Syrian refugees’ conditions. So, this cooperation affect data sharing between Turkey and UN in a positive way.
 
Additionally, a [report](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/CN-3m-Turkey-16-Refugee-E.pdf) of the Expert Group on Refugee and Internally Displaced Persons Statistics - a group associated with the United Nations- says that, “Turkey has always been willing to cooperate with other countries and international organizations especially on development of refugee and displaced population statistics.” When we look at this report, it is safe to say that the Turkish Statistical Institute is not only good at gathering information and conducting studies on Syrian refugees in Turkey, but they are also glad to share data with related organizations. This makes UNCHR’s data pool reliable as they cooperate with Turkish government and associated institutions.
