Turkey will hold snap  election next month, which will be the 18th general -fair- election when the Turkish democracy established was in 1950.


I have collected data about the history of general election results from  the Turkish newspaper Yenişafak’s special data website on elections, which provides detailed information and statistics about political parties and voting percentages in Turkey. When we look at the Turkish voters’ choices in the ballots, it is safe to say that the four main ideologies - center right, center-left, radical-left and radical-right- have dominated the  general elections since 1950. The graph shows average vote of political parties eligible to join elections since 1950. They were classified according to their ideologies. "Others" are parties that don't classify as one of the ideologies. "Invalid votes" are uncounted people's votes. People votes’ which are not counted are named as a “invalid votes.” 

The graph provides information about the average percentage of these four political ideologies in the ballots which will be helpful to understand Turkish voters’ choices since 1950 reflecting on general election results. 

Despite some unpredictable results in the history of general elections, it will be informative before the snap election what is the average percentage of votes for ideologies in Turkey which have been existed since 1950’s. In the history of Turkish democracy, some political parties disappeared, some  were shut down by the Turkish state, but there have been always political parties that represent those four those main political ideologies. Therefore, this graph will be helpful to make better predictions for the snap election. For instance, this graph indicates that center-right parties have always been the favorite for the voters and it will not be surprising, if the current center-right party AKP wins the snap election, according to the graph.
