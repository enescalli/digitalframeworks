Turkey will hold snap elections to select Parliament members and the country’s 13th president  on the 24thof July.  Turkey has more than three million registered  refugees, making the country the number-one destination for displaced Syrians. This huge number  will have lasting effects on the country's demographic, political, and social landscape. Most Turkish people believe that Syrian refugees polarize the society in a negative way.  According to Bilgi University’s recent survey, 86.2 percent of Turkish people say Syrian refugees should be sent back to Syria. What I find surprising is that 83.2 percent of AKP supporters have the same opinion, despite their party’s (AKP)open-border policy since the war begin.  

I'm interested in whether there's a story about Syrian refugees that would have an impact on the AKP’s votes for the next election. I will look at the most  5 Syrian populated cities’ election results in last general election in 2015 to predict how Syrian refugees will affect snap election results.
Here are the features I'll be collecting, and an explanation of why:
* Names of the top five Syrian populated cities
* Number of registered Syrian refugees in those cities 
* Number of citizens who were eligible to votes in those cities
* Percentage of AKP votes 
* Number of hate crime incident against Syrians in those cities since 2011 when refugees started to flee to Turkey. (This is important to have an idea on Turkish people’s attitudes against refugees.)

I will collect data from “multeciler.com” which is one of the reliable websites provides detailed information about refugees in Turkey. I will use yenisafak.com ( the Turkish newspaper ‘s website) to find election results in those 5 cities in last election. 
I will do research in Turkish media outlets such as Sabah Yenisafak and Aksam and Turkish state news agency’s online archive to find the number of hate crime incidents against Syrian refugees.
